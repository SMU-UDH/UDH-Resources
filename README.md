## Facilities Issues?

If it is not an emergency, please go to [this website](https://smu-isd.webtma.net/request_form_single.html) for room temperature issues and [this website](https://smu-isd.webtma.net/request_form_hot.html) for other requests.

If there is an facilities emergency (e.g. power outage, leaking water), please call +1-214-768-7000 and let one of the RAs know. If it is an emergency that warrants the response of the fire department or SMUPD, please call +1-214-768-3333 **IMMEDIATELY**.
